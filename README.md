SoSciKit is an open source web application (MIT license) that simplifies the process of data analysis - making it accessible to a wider community. Based on Python scientific libraries and Flask, the web application allows people to use a number of statistical libraries written in Python through an intuitive graphical user interface with no prerequisite of being either a programmer or a statistician. At the moment the application allows you to perform monovariate, bivariate, cross tabulation and k-mean classification operations. In addition, it allows you to recode categorical variables and create typologies.
